This is the start of a journey!.. At this moment we are not sure if it will be short, long, smooth or tortuous, but we are here for the enjoyment of the ride and the sense of togetherness that comes from a shared vision and the joint efforts!!! so LET'S MAKE IT FUN!

![hello](community.png)

At first, you would ask - Why `azero.fans`?... well, do not dwell much into the reasons of this domain name selection, it was just a cheap option for the time being... so, feel free to propose a brand name for this community, and let's go for it!!!

Also, you have noted that this website is just a variation of the basic template that comes with Docusaurus.. again... it is just a quick solution that was considered more convenient than, let's say, Wordpress :grin: but, if you are a Wordpress ninja.. let's migrate there in a whiff!!

Once again... let's build something fun together!

Cheers!!
