Aleph Zero is having a fresh set of bootnodes!, including the ones from the Community Infrastructure Initiative!

![laces](laces.png)

Following the migration away from single-vendor (ahem.. AWS) in favour of more decentralised solutions, both Aleph Zero chains now start to contain a new set of bootnodes, please remember to update your nodes as soon as convenient!

More information [here](/bootnodes).

You are also warmly invited to contribute to the community infra!.. in case interested, please contact us!!! :handshake:

enjoy!!
