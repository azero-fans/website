Welcome [Ztar](https://x.com/ztrgzng) and [CanadAzero](https://x.com/canadazero1) to the Aleph Zero Community Infrastructure Initiative!

With every initiative there are trailblazers, and in our case it is [Ztar](https://x.com/ztrgzng)  and [CanadAzero](https://x.com/canadazero1) who toook the lead in deploying full RPC archivist services for the testnet and mainnet chains, respectively!!

These services will be incorporated within the next few days to the endpoints:
- `wss://mainnet.azero.fans`, and
- `wss://testnet.azero.fans`

meaning that the latency and quality of services of the wallet at app.azero.fans will greatly improve in Canada and its neighbouring territories.

Many thanks guys!!.. you are awesome!!
