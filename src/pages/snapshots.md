# Snapshots

We are actively looking for community members interested in providing snapshot services to the mainnet and testnet chains.

Please get in contact to coordinate the efforts together!!

Meanwhile, some temporary snapshots are available [here](https://snapshots.azero.fans)

:::warning
Please note that these snapshots were taken from a node runnning Aleph Zero with paritydb database and pruning set to 8192. The snapshots contain the whole `paritydb` folder so download, extract and fix the ownership/permissions accordingly
